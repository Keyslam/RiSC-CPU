# RiSC-CPU

A full implementation of a RiSC CPU as described [here](https://user.eng.umd.edu/~blj/RiSC/).

I'm building this for educational purposes. I might be adding/removing/changing/screwing things up.

This project consists of a few parts which I will be building that I'll be building as time goes on.

- [ ] Lexer & Parser
- [ ] Assembler
- [x] VSCode syntax highlighting
- [ ] Logisim implementation
